8.	What percentage of numbers from 1 to 70 have 1 or 9 in the unit's digit?


To determine what percentage of numbers from 1 to 70 have 1 or 9 in the unit's digit, we first identify the numbers that satisfy this condition.
Numbers with 1 in the unit's digit:

These numbers are: 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61.
Numbers with 9 in the unit's digit:

These numbers are: 9, 19, 29, 39, 49, 59, 69.

Now, count the total number of such numbers:
7 (numbers with 1)+7 (numbers with 9)=14 numbers7 (numbers with 1)+7 (numbers with 9)=14 numbers
Total numbers from 1 to 70:

7070
Calculate the percentage:

Percentage = (14/70)×100

Simplify the fraction:
14/70 = 1/5

Convert to percentage:
1/5 × 100 = 20%

Therefore, 20% of the numbers from 1 to 70 have 1 or 9 in the unit's digit.
