6.	Look at this series: 36, 34, 30, 28, 24, ... What number should come next?


This is an alternating number subtraction series.
36−34=2
34−30=4
30−28=2
28−24=4
In this series first, 2 is subtracted from the first digit then 4 is subtracted from the next digit then again 2 is subtracted from next digit then again 4 is subtracted …. And so on.
So, according to this we have to subtract the digit 24 by 2 to get the correct answer.
24−2=22
The number that should come next is 22.
