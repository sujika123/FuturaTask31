9.	Two numbers are respectively 20% and 50% more than a third number. The ratio of the two numbers is



Let's denote the third number as xx.

The two numbers are:

   1. 20% more than xx:
    x + 0.20x = 1.20x

   2. 50% more than x:
    x + 0.50x = 1.50x

To find the ratio of these two numbers:
Ratio = 1.20x/1.50x

Simplify the ratio:
1.20/1.50 = 12/15 = 4/5

Thus, the ratio of the two numbers is 4/5
Ratio is 4 : 5
