10.	A grocer has a sale of Rs. 6435, Rs. 6927, Rs. 6855, Rs. 7230 and Rs. 6562 for 5 consecutive months.
How much sale must he have in the sixth month so that he gets an average sale of Rs. 6500?



To find the required sale for the sixth month so that the grocer achieves an average sale of Rs. 6500 over six months, follow these steps:

  1.Calculate the total sale needed for six months:
    The average sale is Rs. 6500, so for six months, the total sale needed is:
    6500×6 = 39000

  2.Sum the sales for the first five months:
    6435+6927+6855+7230+6562

    Add these values step-by-step:
    6435+6927 = 13362

    13362+6855 = 20217

    20217+7230 = 27447

    27447+6562 = 34009


  3.Calculate the required sale for the sixth month:
    Let xx be the sale for the sixth month. The total sale including the sixth month should be Rs. 39000:

    34009+x = 39000

    Solving for xx:
    x = 39000−34009

    x = 4991

Thus, the grocer must have a sale of Rs. 4991 in the sixth month to achieve an average sale of Rs. 6500 over six months.
